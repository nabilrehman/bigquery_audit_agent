Okay, here's an analysis of the BigQuery job data and a prioritized optimization brief.

**Overview**

The provided job data consists primarily of queries against `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` and other tables of the same kind, executed by user `admin@nabilrehman.altostrat.com`. The queries extract detailed information about BigQuery jobs, their stages, timelines, and referenced tables.  The recurring job pattern involves selecting *all* columns from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views and then joining and unnesting data, which is inherently inefficient.

**1. Job Pattern Identification**

*   **Dominant Job Pattern:**  The most prevalent and likely most expensive pattern is the query that selects from and joins `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` with `UNNEST` applied to  `job_stages`, `timeline`, and `referenced_tables`.

    *   **Query Signature:** This query pattern has the following signature

    ```sql
        SELECT j.*, stage.*, timeline_entry.*, ref_table.*
        FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS AS j
        LEFT JOIN UNNEST(j.job_stages) AS stage
        LEFT JOIN UNNEST(j.timeline) AS timeline_entry
        LEFT JOIN UNNEST(j.referenced_tables) as ref_table
        WHERE j.creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
          AND j.job_type = 'QUERY'
        ORDER BY j.creation_time DESC
        LIMIT 200
    ```

*   **Other Queries Using INFORMATION_SCHEMA:** There is a smaller cluster of similar queries selecting from, filtering on, and ordering other `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables (e.g., `TABLES`, `COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS`, `TABLE_OPTIONS`, `MATERIALIZED_VIEWS`).  The example shows that queries are run to find the count of tables using this schema.

    ```sql
       SELECT COUNT(*) AS table_count
        FROM `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
    ```

    ```sql
       SELECT option_name, option_type, option_value
        FROM `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_OPTIONS`
        WHERE table_name = @table
        ORDER BY option_name
    ```

*   **User:** All queries are run by `admin@nabilrehman.altostrat.com`. This suggests the queries might be related to a single analytical dashboard or process.

*   **Error Jobs:** A smaller pattern, but still potentially recurring, is attempting to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE`. This table doesn't exist in the `US` region, so these always fail.

    ```sql
        SELECT SUM(total_logical_bytes) AS total_logical_bytes,
            SUM(total_physical_bytes) AS total_physical_bytes
        FROM `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE`
    ```

**2. Reasons for Frequent Jobs**

*   **Monitoring/Auditing:** The main `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` query likely serves a monitoring or auditing dashboard/tool to track recent job activity. The 3-day interval may reflect standard reporting needs. The other queries targeting `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables seem to be running discovery queries as well.

*   **"SELECT *" Anti-Pattern:** All the queries use `SELECT *`.  This is a major inefficiency because it forces BigQuery to scan all columns of the target table(s), even if only a few columns are actually needed.

*   **Lack of Filtering:** the initial `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` does filter on `job_type='QUERY'`, but not any other particularly selective column like `job_id` or `creation_time` (beyond the 3-day interval) which is expensive given it is likely a query on the entire history table.

*   **Schema Exploration:** The queries against other `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables (TABLES, COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS, TABLE_OPTIONS, MATERIALIZED\_VIEWS)  are indicative of schema exploration or automated documentation generation.  These could be reduced via caching.

*   **Error Query:** The query to TABLE\_STORAGE always fails because the table does not exist in the region, and could be turned off in the application.

**3. Optimization Actions (Prioritized)**

1.  **Address the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` Query (High Impact):**

    *   **Problem:** The `SELECT *` combined with unnesting and joins across the history table makes this the most expensive query. It also reads a large amount of data for just last 3 days.
    *   **Solution:**

        1.  **Projection (Column Selection):** Identify *exactly* which columns are needed for the monitoring/auditing use case. Rewrite the query to `SELECT` only those specific columns instead of `j.*, stage.*, timeline_entry.*, ref_table.*`.
        2.  **Filtering and Date-Based Partitioning:** The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` table is partitioned by `creation_time`.  Modify the `WHERE` clause to *explicitly* filter on a range of values within `creation_time`, *and* make that range as narrow as possible while still meeting the reporting requirements. Ideally, if the dashboard/tool refreshes hourly, limit the time window to perhaps 2-4 hours *before* the refresh time. The current three-day window is very high. The goal is to leverage partition pruning.

        ```sql
            WHERE j.creation_time BETWEEN TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 4 HOUR) AND CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
              AND j.job_type = 'QUERY'
        ```

        3.  **Summary Table (Materialization):** Create a *materialized view* or a regularly updated summary table that pre-computes the aggregations and transformations (unnesting, joining) needed for the dashboard.  This shifts the cost of these expensive operations to a scheduled process, and makes the dashboard queries very cheap. This is likely the *best* long-term solution. Update intervals will need to be selected based on use case of the data, if users can tolerate up to 15 minutes of lag on the dashboard, then a 15 minute refresh might be sufficient. If users need to see the information with at most 1 minute delay, consider having a table copy every minute.

        ```sql
          CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW
            `bq-demos-469816.mydataset.summary_jobs` AS
          SELECT
            j.creation_time,
            j.job_id,
            j.user_email,
            j.total_bytes_processed,
            stage.name AS stage_name,
            -- etc., select the needed columns
          FROM
            `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS AS j
            LEFT JOIN UNNEST(j.job_stages) AS stage
          WHERE j.creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)
            AND j.job_type = 'QUERY';
        ```

        4.  **Test Changes**: Use BigQuery Explain to validate that changes are significantly reducing data scanned.

    *   **Expected Savings:** Reducing the amount of data scanned by orders of magnitude (by limiting to 2-4 hours of partition instead of 3 days, and selecting only the necessary columns) can lead to significant cost savings, potentially *hundreds of dollars per day*, especially with a frequently refreshed dashboard.  Materializing the summary will further reduce costs.

2.  **Address `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` & Other Schema Queries (Medium Impact):**

    *   **Problem:** These queries using `SELECT *` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` scan a great amount of data.
    *   **Solution:**

        1.  **Projection (Column Selection):** Select *only* the columns that are needed.
        2.  **Caching (Materialization):**  If the schema exploration is infrequent or used for creating static documentation,  materialize the results of these queries into a small table. The update frequency can be relatively low (e.g., daily or weekly), depending on how often your schema changes.
        3.  **Check Location:** Ensure the job is reading tables that are present in US multi region instead of attempting to query other regions.
        4.  **Consider using a Data Catalog tool:** Utilize a tool like BigQuery Data Catalog, Dataplex, or a similar solution for exploring metadata.

    *   **Expected Savings:**  Savings will depend on the size of your schema and the current query costs, but should be noticeable with schema stabilization and column selection.

3.  **Eliminate Erroneous Queries (High Impact):**

    *   **Problem:** The query to `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE` fails and wastes resources.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **Fix region:** If these queries are needed check with Google Cloud documentation to see if there are available tables in the appropriate regions for your organization.
        2.  **Application Logic:** Remove or correct the query in the application code.

    *   **Expected Savings:** Direct savings by preventing the recurring execution of the erroneous query and processing of data.

**Additional Considerations**

*   **Query Scheduling:** Review the schedules of any automated queries and make sure they are aligned with actual reporting/usage needs. Avoid extremely frequent (e.g., sub-hourly) refreshes if the data doesn't change that often. Consider batching operations or using incremental updates for your tables, so you only operate on new data.

*   **User Education:** Train the user (admin@nabilrehman.altostrat.com) on BigQuery best practices, such as avoiding `SELECT *` and using appropriate filtering.

*   **Monitoring Tools:** Implement monitoring and alerting based on cost thresholds to quickly identify and address new or unexpected expensive queries.

*   **Resource Tags:** Tag these queries. For example, "INFORMATION\_SCHEMA\_QUERY". This helps in further analysis and filtering.

By implementing these changes, you can significantly reduce costs, improve query performance, and ensure that BigQuery resources are being used effectively. Note that this information is derived from single data points and may not be representative of the actual load pattern.
